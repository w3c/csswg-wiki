====== Test the Web Forward, Beijing 2012 ======

===== People =====


==== who are interested in participating as speakers ====
  * Kang-Hao (Kenny) Lu (Oupeng/Opera, regular www-style participant) - I can talk about whatever that's assigned to me. The topics I proposed to Dyvia were around "How are specs proses like? How to read specs? How to game the specs with corner cases? Example. Example. Example." I will be speaking in Mandarin.

==== who are interested in participating as reviewers ====
  * Jin Long Zhang (Oupeng/Opera, Web compatibility engineer)

===== Specs =====
Some of the specs that were discussed during the local meeting.

  * CSSOM
  * Canvas2DContext - We would like to include this, but let's discuss it.
  * <del>CSS Transitions</del> - too hard to write tests
  * <del>CSS3 Text, Writing Modes</del> - albeit relating to Chinese layout. It is often not really something Web developers are interested in.
  * DOM4 


===== Note =====
  * I(Kenny)'d note that the Adobe China team suggests that we enroll as many local speakers/reviewers as possible. I personally find that reasonable given previous experience (some people just dislike English, and it often happens that these speakers end up having very little interaction with local people, etc. etc.), but I should note that it's not easy to find relevant people.
