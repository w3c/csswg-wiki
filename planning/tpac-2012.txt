====== TPAC 2012 ======

CSS will probably meet during [[http://www.w3.org/2012/10/TPAC/|TPAC 2012]], which runs from Monday 29 October through Friday 2 November, in Lyon, France.  (Have we figured out yet if we'll want additional days in addition to the Monday-Tuesday or Thursday-Friday that we'd get within the TPAC structure?)
