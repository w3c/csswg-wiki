==== CSS Object Model for CSS Regions ====

=== Flowed content boxes and DOM access ===

== getClientRects and getBoundingClientRects ==

The DOM specification provides a [[http://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-view/#the-getclientrects-and-getboundingclientrect-methods|way]] 
to compute the bounding client rectangle for an element (getBoundingClientRect()) and its generated 
boxes (getClientRects). 

The current definition seems appropriate for CSS regions and the multiple boxes generated
for an element flowing through multiple regions. The getClientRects method would return the list of boxes for the 
element found in the different regions. The <code>getBoundingClientRect</code> would work as specified.

== offsetWidth/offsetHeight/offsetTop/offsetLeft ==

The offsetWidth/offsetHeight/offsetTop/offsetLeft attributes would work as specified, using the first box, i.e., the
first part of the element flowing in a region. The usefulness of that is limited, but it is the same situation as for elements
flowing in a multi-column.

The clientTop/clientLeft/clientWidth/clientHeight attributes are relative to the padding edge of the element. For
an element fragmented accross region, the padding edge would be made of the outermost edges, for all the element's fragment boxes. 
However, this does not seem to be the way implementations work for multi-column content, where the WebKit and Opera browsers 
report the edges of the element as if it was laid out in a single column (i.e., as if it appended all the fragments in the 
box direction), Firefox reports the edges of the first fragment's box.
