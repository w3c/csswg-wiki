====== css4-ui features list ======

The [[http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-ui/|CSS Basic User Interface Module Level 3]] (CSS3-UI, latest Editor's draft) defines user interface related selectors, properties and values.

CSS3-UI is deliberately scoped to what's been interoperably implemented, so it's a firm stake in the ground that implementers and authors can depend on.

CSS4-UI is for new features above and beyond CSS3-UI.

In somewhat order of priority:

===== extensions to css3-ui features =====
Implementations may have found it useful to extend existing CSS3-UI features, but perhaps they are only experimental extensions or single implementations.

As these are most likely to be practical and minimal (and supported by a second implementation), these are the first features we'll consider.

  * ...

Second, users, authors may have found that they wanted a CSS3-UI feature to work a certain way beyond the spec, and these real world needs are a second consideration.

  * ...

Third, there are hypothetical requests for extensions to CSS3-UI features. As these are not real world proven (only theoretical) demands, they are purely tertiary. We may consider them optimistically and include them in working drafts to solicit feedback and additional interest.

  * ...

===== new css4-ui features =====
Brand new features fo CSS4-UI. We'll follow the same prioritization as above.

  * ...

===== dropped css3-ui features =====
Features that were dropped from CSS3-UI (e.g. the 2004 CR) are eligible to be considered for CSS4-UI, but they will need a strong justification as having been ignored by implementations for 6+ years means there was likely something wrong with them and they need major revising.

===== Current Issues =====

There is no editor's draft of CSS3 UI yet - so there's nothing to have issues against!

The editor's draft will eventually be here:
